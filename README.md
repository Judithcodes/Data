## Introduction
This repository is an official data workspace of AI^{2} research group.

The research goal of AI^{2] research group is to develop an AI-based User Adaptive interaction systems.  
Our system aims to automatically adapt interaction designs to maximize user experiences.

The first domain of intersest of our group is a voice user interface (VUI).  
The dataset consists of various biological feedbacks from users while interacting with VUI systems.
